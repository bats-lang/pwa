# pwa

pwa writes the shell around a Bats WASM app: the PWA's `index.html`,
`manifest.json`, `bridge.js` and service worker, and the Capacitor
project of its Android app.

## pwa emits no JS logic

JS lives only in bridge, as thin atoms (each with its `*_available`,
its answers decoded into datatypes), and the app's logic lives in the
app, in Bats, on those atoms (bats-lang/pwa#49).

* The page's one script is bridge's (`bridge.js`); `index.html` holds no
  inline script, and no element, class or attribute of pwa's own
  (`pwa-*`, `data-pwa-*`) that a script would act on.
* The service worker is bridge's (`produce_service_worker`), share
  target included: pwa adds no handler to it.
* The Android activity (`MainActivity.java`) runs no JS of its own: it
  calls bridge's entry points, `globalThis.batsNative.deliverFile(url,
  name)` for a file it hands over and `globalThis.batsNative.key(name)`
  for a volume key, one call each, and reads their answer.

## Changes to pwa

Further changes to pwa are disallowed: the only modifications allowed
are bug fixes (current functionality that misbehaves) or adding new
platforms (iOS, Electron, …). A feature the app needs from the platform
is a bridge atom and the app's own code, never pwa's.
